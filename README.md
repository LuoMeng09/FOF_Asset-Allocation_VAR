The Vector Autoregression (VAR) model analyzes the interrelationships among variables, including the effects of factors on each other with a lag of p periods. It relies on data rather than strict economic theory to demonstrate relationships, offering good econometric properties. Unlike traditional linear fundamental models that focus on the impact of order changes on themselves, VAR also examines the influence of other factors' lagged orders. In other words, VAR's structure is richer, allowing analysis of how past trading signals in major categories respond to current trades. It is dynamic and unconstrained, reducing complexity and enhancing predictive power. This study applies VAR based on economic fundamentals and financial environment, including overseas, valuation, and market sentiment data for the financial environment, and inflation and economic momentum data for economic fundamentals. Using these data, it tests the effectiveness of VAR in predicting market style rotation based on previously constructed index models.
